# Master_project

Scene.ttt is the scene file for CoppeliaSim.

ctrl.py deals with the simulation and data collection part for Scene.ttt.

read_data.py is to read the data for a single file in 'Original_data'.

There will be a folder called 'Objects' to update all tested objects.

Files in 'Original_data' are named as 'object name_grasp mode_value of Soft CFM'(Modifying Soft CFM is supposed to simulte the change of objects' softness, see soft_CFM.png).
